# SP25-Lab1-Template

**This repository contains:**

(1) Lab1.pdf -- this is the file you will aim to recreate.

(2) template.Rnw -- this is the Rnw file template you will start with

(3) bib.bib -- this is the biblography file for the template

**Instructions:**

Start with template.Rnw and recreate Lab1.pdf. 

This will require some typing! Note that should you choose to copy-and-paste, you may find errors with unicode characters (a famous example is U+2212 is a special minus sign that is slightly different from the one we type).

**VITAL INFORMATION**

(1) Write your code in a .R file. When you are sure it's what you want, copy it over to your .Rnw file.

(2) Compile your .rnw file often! It's so much easier to fix when you know (almost) exactly where the problem is.

(3) Save to GitHub often (e.g., at the end of each `big thing' -- maybe each section). This will ensure good digital hygiene.
